         * A palindrome is a word that is read the same forwards and backwards.
         * Some examples include:
         *      racecar, level, tenet
         * For the sample problem's case, simply echo back the word to the user along with
         * a concatenation of the word in reverse.
         * 
         * The input from the user can be n-length long.  The input may appear as:
         * "r a c e\n"
         * 
         * Note that the user is entering in each character individually followed by a
         * space character to indicate the next letter.
         * 
         * "\n" indicates that the user has entered the "Enter" key and the program should
         * stop prompting the user for the next character.
         * 
         * The output from the program should appear as:
         *  "racecar"
